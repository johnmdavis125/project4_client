## Albums App

+ Full CRUD ruby on rails backend with 1 resource/model called albums
+ React App front end which displays the albums (index) and allows user to create new albums (create)

+ Comment: I was able to deploy the back-end to Heroku but ran out of time to deploy the front end as well. 

I look forward to coming back to this project to complete it in more robust fashion after my final project is over.
